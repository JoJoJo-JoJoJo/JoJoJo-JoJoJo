- 👋 Hi, I’m JoJo.
- 👀 I’m interested in Maths, Physics, Music, and all areas of programming!
- 🌱 I'm currently learning D3 in order to complete the Data Visulisation Certification on FreeCodeCamp, and I'm trying to figure out how to integrate this library with React and TypeScript (it's annoying at times). I'm also starting to learn how to use React-Query and React-Router.
- 💞️ I’m looking to start building my own front-end projects for now to build experience. These should include a portfolio piece about me, and some sort of fitness/productivity app.
- 📫 How to reach me: GitHub (reach out to me on GitHub if you need an email).
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I taught myself how to read when I was 2!

#Languages learnt so far:
- HTML
- CSS, SCSS & Tailwind
- JavaScript, TypeScript & React
