- 👋 Hi, I’m Jonah.
- 👀 I’m interested in Maths, Physics, Music, and all areas of programming!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Front End Web Development --> (HTML, CSS (regular, SCSS and Tailwind), JS and React learnt (or at least to a decent level) so far, going on to do TS then probably Next JS and MongoDB).
- 💞️ I’m looking to start building my own front-end projects for now to build experience, and then implement database, server-side and backend featurs into my projects over time.
- 📫 How to reach me: I guess just github for now?
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I taught myself how to read when I was 2!
